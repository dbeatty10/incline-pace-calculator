## Overview

This project provides a suite of web-based calculators for runners to convert between flat and incline-adjusted paces. These tools help you analyze past efforts and plan future workouts by adjusting for elevation changes and treadmill inclines.

## Use Cases

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrospective Analysis
Evaluate past runs by adjusting paces for elevation changes. These calculators help you answer:
- *"What was my effort-equivalent flat pace (GAP) for a hilly run?"*
- *"How would that track workout translate to a 10% incline?"*
- *"How steep was that climb based on my elevation gain and distance ran?"*
- *"What is the corresponding gradient for my actual pace and GAP?"*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prospective Planning
Plan future workouts with incline-adjusted paces to simulate different conditions:
- *"What treadmill speeds and gradients correspond to my flat pace of 8:00 min/mile?"*
- *"If I run at a 5% incline, what pace should I target to match my flat effort of 5:10 min/km?"*
- *"At what incline on the treadmill would I match the performance difference between my target flat pace and my uphill pace?"*
